# Rmd-Drug-Sensitivity-Analysis
# Developed to assess cell growth kinetics over 24 hours in a 96 well plate utilizing spectrometry for optical density readings.
# This is specific towards plate set ups that use 4 different drug concentrations and 3 technical replicates.
# Code includes data cleaning and proposed plots for showcasing data.
# Plots can be customized by changing aesthetics and features.
